# Express Server

A simple Node.js server built with Express to serve APIs or web content.

## Features
- RESTful API support
- Middleware integration (body parsing, logging, error handling)
- CORS enabled
- Environment-based configuration
- Easily extendable architecture

## Prerequisites
Before running the server, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Getting Started
### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/subhamdey1234/express_server_todolist
cd your-repo-name
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
or with yarn:
```bash
yarn install
```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following variables:
```
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Run the Server
For development:
```bash
npm run dev
```
For production:
```bash
npm start
```

The server will start at `http://localhost:3000`.
